# AI-In-Practice Working Group

This is the main repository of the AI-In-Practice Working Group.

The AI-In-Practice Working Group aims to co-develop publicly shareable references (code / best-practices) on practical applications of AI for areas such as productivity, security, governance, sustainability & culture, with an emphasis on collaborative learning (i.e. learning by doing).

A Working Group is like a Study Group, but instead of preparing to pass an exam, participants focus on discussions and activities around a specific subject area. Think of it like an extended Hackathon, where a Hackathon focuses on intense collaboration within a day or two, the Working Group collaborates over 
5 two-hour sessions, spread out over 5 months. 

> *Wikipedia Working Group definition:* A group of experts working together to achieve specified goals. Such groups are domain-specific and focus on discussion or activity around a specific subject area. The term can sometimes refer to an interdisciplinary collaboration of researchers, often from more than one organization, working on new activities that would be difficult to sustain under traditional funding mechanisms.

## Principles

1. Codify & automate
2. Learn in public
3. Non-event
4. Less theory, more practice
5. Pivot when necessary
